This is the version of AFRESh as used for the measurements described in the paper "AFRESh: An Adaptive Framework for Compression of Reads and Assembled Sequences with Random Access Functionality", published in the Oxford Bioinformatics journal.

It should be noted that processing speed is lower due to the compilation of the JAVA-code into binary executables.

Example configuration files can be found in the configs directory.

The run_AFRESh.bat file will run the compression tool with a preconfigured configuration file.
